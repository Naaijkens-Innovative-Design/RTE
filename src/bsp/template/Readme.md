# YAPLC architecture overvew

YAPC consists of several components including:
* Beremiz,
* matiec,
* YAPLC/IDE,
* YAPLC/RTE,
* GNU ARM embedded toolchain,
* stm32flash

# YAPLC/RTE

YAPLC/RTE is runtime environment which can run Beremiz/matiec generated softPLC.
It can be compiled in one executable file with softPLC or YAPLC/RTE may be used as PLC firmware
which may run softPLC which is compiled and linked as a separate executable file.

YAPLC/RTE uses plc ABI for communivation with softPLC. 

The ABI if defined in src/plc_abi.h it consists of several data structures which are placed in special 
sections of executable files during the link phase.

These structures are:

* **plc_rte_abi_t** - YAPLC/RTE side ABI which is used by softPLC. The global variable of this type is placed at **plc_rte_sec** section, its address must be passed to softPLC during compile phase by means of PLC_RTE_ADDR define which is generated by YAPLC/IDE.
* **plc_app_abi_t** - softPLC side ABI which is used by YAPLC/RTE. The global variable of this type is placed at **plc_app_abi_sec** section of softPLC executabe. This structure consist of several pointers to other interface structures on softPLC side.
* **plc_loc_tbl_t** - location table generated in softPLC on compile phase. The global variable of this type is blaced at softPLC **data** section. 
This table is used by YAPLC/RTE IO manager to connect device drivers with located variables of softPLC. The table consists of location descriptors.
* **plc_loc_dsc_t** - location descriptor. This structure contains data which is used by YAPLC/RTE IO manager to communicate with softPLC.

# YAPLC/IDE

YAPLC/IDE is a set of Beremiz plugins which
