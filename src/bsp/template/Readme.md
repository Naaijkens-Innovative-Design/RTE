# YAPLC architecture overvew

YAPC consists of several components including:
* Beremiz,
* matiec,
* YAPLC/IDE,
* YAPLC/RTE,
* GNU ARM embedded toolchain,
* stm32flash

# YAPLC/RTE

YAPLC/RTE is runtime environment which can run Beremiz/matiec generated softPLC.
It can be compiled in one executable file with softPLC or YAPLC/RTE may be used as PLC firmware
which may run softPLC which is compiled and linked as a separate executable file.

## ABI
YAPLC/RTE uses plc ABI for communivation with softPLC. 

The ABI if defined in src/plc_abi.h it consists of several data structures which are placed in special 
sections of executable files during the link phase.

These structures are:

* **plc_rte_abi_t** - YAPLC/RTE side ABI which is used by softPLC. The global variable of this type is placed at **plc_rte_sec** section, its address must be passed to softPLC during compile phase by means of PLC_RTE_ADDR define which is generated by YAPLC/IDE.
* **plc_app_abi_t** - softPLC side ABI which is used by YAPLC/RTE. The global variable of this type is placed at **plc_app_abi_sec** section of softPLC executabe. This structure consist of several pointers to other interface structures on softPLC side.
* **plc_loc_tbl_t** - location table generated in softPLC on compile phase. The global variable of this type is blaced at softPLC **data** section. 
This table is used by YAPLC/RTE IO manager to connect device drivers with located variables of softPLC. The table consists of location descriptors.
* **plc_loc_dsc_t** - location descriptor. This structure contains data which is used by YAPLC/RTE IO manager to communicate with softPLC.

## IO manager
YAPLC/RTE IO mansger controls PLC hardware drivers and communicates with softPLC. IO manager schedules PLCs IO activity. On each softPLC run plc_iom_get() is called before softPLC code and plc_iom_set() is called after softPLC code. Every work cycle plc_iom_poll() is called to schedule asynchronous IO activity.

IO manager workflow is:

* Init hardware.
* Check hardware.
* After softPLC cstartuo code is called - check and sort locations. Locations are first sorted in three groups: **inputs**, **memories**, **outputs**. Ihside these groups locations are sorted based on IO protocol (driver) IDs. After first sort locations are checked vor validity, if no erorrs found, then protocol specific sort is done for **inputs**, **memories** and **outputs**.
* Initiate IO activities on softPLC start.
* Poll drivers every main loop cycle.
* Get and set driver variables every softPLC cycle.
* Terminate IO activities on softPLC stop.

# YAPLC/IDE

YAPLC/IDE is a set of Beremiz plugins which
